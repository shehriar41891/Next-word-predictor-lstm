It won't ever hurt you to ask for advice from others. Asking for more than one opinion helps you see all different viewpoints, the best possible answer, and less pressure.\\n\\nWhen you ask multiple people for advice on something you get many viewpoints. This will help you because you can depict between all the advice you receive and have a less bias answer. I always prefer to get different view points because it makes me feel reassured knowing I have many options to go about with my decision. For example, if I am shopping for a dress and I see a cute one but I'm not sure about it, I'd ask my friends for their opinion, and that will help my final choice. With multiple viewpoints you can have a more thought about answer with the pros and negatives. Every viewpoint will either be different or possibly even the same which will narrow down your answer.\\n\\nMaking decisions are always going to be stressful which is why asking for others for advice is good because it'll bring less pressure. Your decision may be big or large but no matter what it can always be stressful, so when you ask for advice it can take some pressure off of you. I always find it to be less stressful when I go to someone and tell them I'm having a hard time with a decision, and they give me some advice to go about it. Sometimes you just need to relax before any type of decision. Would you rather have a very stressful decision to make on your own or a big decision with advice from others which will bring less stress? Big decisions can cause bad stress which may result in a loss in appetite and could also make you sad or have anxiety. However, if you do ask someone for help on your decision you can avoid all of that stress and have a better outcome.\\n\\nAsking others for advice will almost always leave you with a better outcome.\\n\\nI know this because without seeing how other people view this decision will just be a bias answer and probably not that good of a decision. Sometimes you just need to take a moment to think of others opinion and think if they'd agree with your decision. If you think about it and you're having second thoughts, then it's probably not the best decision you can do. Like for instance, I made a decision to play games instead of watch a movie for my class and many people were upset with me, which made me realize I have to take others viewpoints into the picture. However, if you ask other people for their opinion then you can see if their opinion differs from yours and work on a new one.\\n\\nWith all of that being said asking others for advice can bring less stress a better outcome and many viewpoints. If you ask for advice you can take time is review and reflect on what the best possible outcome for you and others may be. Therefore, leaving you with a well thought about answer.\",\n          \" The path to success in life is paved with positivity. It is crucial to be positive in your decisions, as this will ultimately determine whether you achieve your goals and dreams. While it may be tempting to take decisions based on what others say, it is essential to believe in yourself and what you want to achieve.\\n\\nWhen I started school, I was both positive and negative. On one hand, I was excited about what I wanted to achieve and what my goals were. On the other hand, I was unsure of myself and my surroundings. However, I soon realized that I had one reason to keep going: my son. I was determined to provide him with a better future, and this motivation kept me going.\\n\\nAs time passed, I found important people in my life who helped me stay positive. My friends were always positive and supportive, and their encouragement helped me feel more confident in myself. When I talked to them, I felt a sense of positivity and hope for the future.\\n\\nNow, as I enter my final year of school, I feel good about where I am and what I have achieved. I am confident that I can make my dreams a reality, and I am excited to see what the future holds.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that life is full of challenges and obstacles, and it is crucial to be prepared for anything that comes your way. However, with a positive attitude and a strong belief in yourself, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your goals.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the key to achieving success in life is to always be positive, strong, and believe in yourself. No matter what new changes come your way, never give up and always put your life in God's hands.\",\n          \"Technology has revolutionized the way we live our lives. From smartphones to smart homes, technology has made our lives easier, more Convenient, and more productive. However, it has also brought its own set of problems and Challenges. In this essay, I will Compare the positive and negative aspects of technology.\\n\\nOn the positive side, technology has brought about significant advancements in various fields. For example, in healthcare, technology has enabled doctors to diagnose and treat diseases more accurately and efficiently. In education, technology has made learning more accessible and interactive. With the help of the internet, students An access a wealth of information and resources from anywhere in the world.\\n\\nMoreover, technology has made Communication easier and faster. With the help of social media and messaging apps, people An now Communicate with each other from different parts of the world in real-time. This has made it easier for businesses to Collaborate and for individuals to stay in touch with their loved ones.\\n\\nOn the negative side, technology has also brought about its own set of problems. One of the biggest Concerns is the impact of technology on our mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of technology An lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Additionally, technology has also led to a decline in physical activity, as people spend more time sitting in front of screens and less time engaging in physical activities.\\n\\nAnother Concern is the impact of technology on our social skills. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, people are becoming more isolated and less social. This An lead to a decline in social skills and make it harder for people to form meaningful relationships.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, technology has brought about significant advancements in various fields, making our lives easier, more Convenient, and more productive. However, it has also brought about its own set of problems and Challenges, such as the impact on our mental health, physical activity, and social skills. It is important to strike a balance between using technology and engaging in other activities that promote our overall wellbeing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
